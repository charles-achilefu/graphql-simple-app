# GraphQL Example using Angular and Apollo 

This is a simple project built with the Angular CLI and the Apollo client to demonstrate the capabilities of GraphQL.

## Running the App

To run the client portion of the application, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies. 

```
git clone https://github.com/onehungrymind/graphql-simple-app.git
cd graphl-simple-app
npm i
npm start
``` 

You will also need to start run the server. 

```
cd api
npm i
npm start
```

Once both the server and client are running, you can navigate to [http:localhost:4200](http:localhost:4200) to see the application.
